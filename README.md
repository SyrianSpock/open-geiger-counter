Description
-----------

The <a href="http://opengeiger.de/index_en.html">Open geiger</a> project aims to give access to cheap geiger counters for the masses.
This is an attempt at making such a cheap geiger counter - using PIN diodes and following the design of the 'Stuttgarter Geigerle'- in a smaller size form.
In this repository are made available the production files for the realisation of such a cheap pocket geiger counter:
  * <a href="open-geiger-counter/schematic.pdf">Schematic</a>
  * <a href="open-geiger-counter/kicad">Kicad files</a>
  * <a href="open-geiger-counter/gerber">Gerber files</a>
  * 3D printed case (TBD)
